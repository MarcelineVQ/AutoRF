Auto Raid Farm
===

Automatic management of raid farm parties.  

This addon requires party members to be in your leader's friend list.  
It will handle inviting them as they come online and kicking them as they go offline.  

The intent is that the group forming character adds the farming characters to its friends list and also to `/autorf add` then sits around with this addon on. As the alts log in and out it if managed the raid for them.  

The friends list requirement is due to api limitations. This addon is intended to be used with addons like lazypigs which automatially accept invites from friends.
